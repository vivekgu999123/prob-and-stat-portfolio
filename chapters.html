        Unit I: Description of Data & Probability
      </button>

      <div class="accordion-body">

        <h4>Chapter 1: Description of Data</h4>
        <p>
          Introduces statistical data, types of variables, and numerical
          measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graphical tools including histograms and box plots are used
          to visualize data distribution, variability, and skewness.
        </p>
        <div class="learning-box">
  <h5>What I Learned</h5>
  <p>
    From this chapter, I learned how to classify data and summarize it using
    appropriate statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance,
    and standard deviation. I also learned how graphical tools like histograms
    and box plots help in understanding data distribution, variability, and
    skewness.
  </p>
</div>


        <h4>Chapter 2: Probability</h4>
        <p>
          Covers fundamental probability concepts, addition and
          multiplication rules, conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphasis is placed on modeling uncertainty and decision-making
          using probabilistic reasoning.
        </p>
        <div class="learning-box">
  <h5>What I Learned</h5>
  <p>
    This chapter helped me understand probability as a mathematical way of
    handling uncertainty. I learned to apply addition and multiplication rules,
    conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem to solve real-world and
    engineering-related problems.

        Unit II: Random Variables & Statistical Inference
      </button>

      <div class="accordion-body">

        <h4>Chapter 3: Random Variables and Probability Distributions</h4>
        <p>
          Introduces discrete and continuous random variables and
          probability distributions such as Binomial, Poisson, and Normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mean, variance, PDF, CDF, and graphical interpretation
          of distributions are studied.
        </p>
        <div class="learning-box">
  <h5>What I Learned</h5>
  <p>
    From this chapter, I learned how random variables are used to represent
    outcomes of random experiments. I gained understanding of discrete and
    continuous distributions and learned to apply Binomial, Poisson, and Normal
    distributions to model practical situations.
  </p>
</div>


        <h4>Chapter 4: Statistical Inference</h4>
        <p>
          Focuses on sampling methods, confidence intervals,
          and hypothesis testing for means and proportions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Z-tests and t-tests are applied to draw conclusions
          about populations from sample data.
        </p>
        <div class="learning-box">
  <h5>What I Learned</h5>
  <p>
    This chapter taught me how conclusions about a population can be drawn using
    sample data. I learned the concepts of sampling, confidence intervals, and
    hypothesis testing, and how Z-tests and t-tests are used to make data-driven
    decisions.
