<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
The course Fundamentals of Probability and Statistics helped me understand how data
can be analyzed and interpreted systematically. I learned to summarize datasets
using measures of central tendency and dispersion, and to visualize data using
graphs such as histograms and box plots.
</p>

<p>
The study of probability concepts and distributions improved my ability to reason
under uncertainty and model real-world problems. Topics like hypothesis testing
and confidence intervals gave me a clear understanding of how conclusions about
populations can be drawn from sample data.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this subject strengthened my analytical thinking and provided a strong
foundation for data-driven applications in computer science.
